# Super Ultra 1

## Overview

Super Ultra 1 is an autonomous robot designed to navigate and avoid obstacles using ultrasonic distance measurement and motor control. It uses a series of predefined turns to maneuver around obstacles detected in its path.

## Components

- **Arduino Board**: Microcontroller for managing sensors and motors.
- **DC Motors**: Two motors for robot movement.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measures distance to detect obstacles.
- **Motor Driver**: Controls the direction and speed of the DC motors.
- **Power Supply**: Provides power to the robot and its components.
